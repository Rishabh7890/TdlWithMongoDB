# TdlWithMongoDB

#### An updated version of the basic to-do list I created earlier which includes MongoDB and the ability to add as many custom lists as you would like!

#### Default list will have the current date and time as the title. To create new custom lists, simply add a forward slash followed by whatever you would like to call the list in the url. This will create a new list with your custom title.

## Technologies used:

* Javascript
* Express Server
* Node
* MomentJS
* CSS
* EJS 
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
